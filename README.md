<h2 align="center"> This project was made in purpose for the Covid-19 Gameathon organized by Angelhack. </h2>  
The repository contains both the PC and the android AR build.
<li>The PC build can be found inside the Build folder.<br></li>
<li>The .apk file for the AR build can be found inside the Build_Android_APK.rar file which in turn is inside the Build_Android_APK folder.<br></li>
<li>The .apk file for the AR build can also be found in the github releases page related to the repository.<br></li>

<h2 align="center"> The Problem Statement </h2>  
In an attempt to fight the virus, this hackathon calls upon developers to create innovative games that address issues faced by people during the pandemic. We are supposed to design a game that will help bring about awareness about the on going pandemic.

<h2 align="center"> Solution </h2>  
Our game takes the essentials of hygiene practices such as frequent sanitizing, social distancing, protecting oneself with a mask etc. into a fun and exciting PC and mobile FPS, surviving with the help of others (yes, it is a multiplayer through and through, without the support for others, the game will end a little too quick) and fending against the swarms of COVID virus cells and each other.

<h2 align="center"> Game Concept </h2>  
The game includes:
<li>Pseudo 2nd person perspective gameplay<br></li>
<li>RL trained enemy virus cells that reduce health of player whilst in proximity<br></li>
<li>Photon API powered multiplayer features<br></li>
<li>Oh yeah, there is an AR version as well<br></li>

<h2 align="center"> Tech Stack </h2>  

Purpose | Tool
------- | -------
Character and Enemy Movement | Unity 2020.4 LTS
Enemy Training  | Unity ML Agents
Enemy, Character and interactable models |  Blender
Multiplayer Integration | Photon API (PUN 2)
AR Integration | Unity Engine x AR Foundation
UI Implementation |  Unity UI x Affinity Designer

<h2 align="center"> Game Design </h2>  
<li>The player is equipped with a sanitizer gun which is used to shoot the virus particles.<br></li>
<li>If the player comes in contact with a particle, it will respawn. <br></li>
<li>Going too close to the particle  reduces players health. <br></li>
<li>Shooting other players with sanitizer results in the increase of health but approaching another player results in the violation of social distance. <br></li>
<li>Masks are present and collecting them increases health of the player. <br></li>
<li>The Reinforced Learned COVID particles have a win/lose reward state which makes the floor red in the player infected state and green if the player successfully evades the particles. <br></li>
<li>As a survivalistic aspect, only the other players can view your playerâ€™s health and vice versa that enables them to help each other to fend off against the onslaught of COVID virus cells. <br></li>


<h2 align="center"> Platforms and features </h2>  
<li>Microsoft Windows<br></li>
<li>Android 7.0 and above (ARCore supported devices only)<br></li>
