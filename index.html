<h2 align="left"> This project is the 3rd place winner in the Covid-19 Gameathon organized by Angelhack. </h2>  
<h2 align="left"> This project was made in purpose for the Covid-19 Gameathon organized by Angelhack. </h2>  
The repository contains both the PC and the android AR build.
<li>The PC build can be found inside the Build folder.<br></li>
<li>The .apk file for the AR build can be found inside the Build_Android_APK.rar file which in turn is inside the Build_Android_APK folder.<br></li>
<li>The .apk file for the AR build can also be found in the github releases page related to the repository.<br></li>

<h2 align="left"> The Problem Statement </h2>  
In an attempt to fight the virus, this hackathon calls upon developers to create innovative games that address issues faced by people during the pandemic. We are supposed to design a game that will help bring about awareness about the on going pandemic.

<h2 align="left"> Solution </h2>  
Our game takes the essentials of hygiene practices such as frequent sanitizing, social distancing, protecting oneself with a mask etc. into a fun and exciting PC and mobile FPS, surviving with the help of others (yes, it is a multiplayer through and through, without the support for others, the game will end a little too quick) and fending against the swarms of COVID virus cells and each other.

<h2 align="left"> Game Concept </h2>  
The game includes:
<li>Pseudo 2nd person perspective gameplay<br></li>
<li>RL trained enemy virus cells that reduce health of player whilst in proximity<br></li>
<li>Photon API powered multiplayer features<br></li>
<li>Oh yeah, there is an AR version as well<br></li>
